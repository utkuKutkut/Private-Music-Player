# Java Private Music Player Application Template
This project is about a small Java application to create a private music player. User can maintain information about songs, genre and playlists.\
For the first source, it has a command-line interface\
The second source has a Graphical User Interface with backend database connection and MD5 algorithm to do security checks.\
Subscriptions' payment options are not functional, could be used as a template.

**MD5 Algorithm**\
The MD5 function is a cryptographic algorithm that takes an input of arbitrary length and produces a message digest that is 128 bits long. The MD5 message digest hashing algorithm processes data in 512-bit blocks, broken down into 16 words composed of 32 bits each. To be considered cryptographically secure MD5 should meet two requirements:\
<br>
-It is impossible to generate two inputs that cannot produce the same hash function.\
-It is impossible to generate a message having the same hash value.\
